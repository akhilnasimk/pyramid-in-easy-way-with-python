In this simple code we can remove the i,j,k form of code that is hard for the most people and make it simple by just calculating the space of each line needed by substracting line number from number of rows we can make it close to left side by adjusting space btween the "* " string 


to left: remove the h string
to right : print h string only in one side
for normal : print as it is
